    "- **File:** `research/Dairy_Supply_Demand_20000.csv`\n",
    "- **Action:** Examine the columns, data types, missing values, and overall structure.\n",
    "- **Goal:** Identify relevant features (e.g., date, SKU, supply, demand, downtime, etc.) and the target variable for forecasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Update Schema\n",
    "- **File:** `schema.yaml`\n",
    "- **Action:** Ensure the schema matches the columns and data types in your dairy dataset.\n",
    "- **Goal:** Accurate data validation and transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.3 Adapt Data Ingestion\n",
    "- **Files:** `src/MLproject/components/data_ingestion.py`, `config/config.yaml`\n",
    "- **Action:** Update the data ingestion logic to read the dairy CSV and handle any specific requirements (e.g., date parsing, column renaming).\n",
    "- **Goal:** Reliable and repeatable data loading.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.4 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- **Files:** `research/01_data_ingestion.ipynb` or a new notebook\n",
    "- **Action:** Analyze distributions, trends, missing values, outliers, and relationships between features.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Actions:**\n",
    "- Parse `Date` and extract features: day of week, month, year, etc.\n",
    "- Create lag features (previous day/week demand, supply, etc.).\n",
    "- Calculate rolling averages (e.g., 7-day mean demand).\n",
