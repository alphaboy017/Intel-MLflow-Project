# MLflow-Project

## Project Transformation Summary

This project was originally a generic MLflow-based machine learning pipeline template. It has been transformed into a specialized demand forecasting solution for Flavi Dairy Solutions, Ahmedabad. The focus is now on predicting dairy supply and inventory demand to optimize processing, packaging, and storage capacities. The project is now ready for deployment on platforms like Render, with experiment tracking handled via MLflow and DagsHub.

## ðŸ¥› Dairy Demand Forecasting

**Organisation:** Flavi Dairy Solutions, Ahmedabad  
**Category:** Industry defined problem

### Project Description
Maximizing the utilization of processing, packaging, and storage capacities is crucial for cost-efficiency and profitability in dairy plants. This project aims to forecast demand and optimize supply/inventory, addressing challenges such as fluctuating milk supply, demand variability, SKU changes, equipment downtime, and inefficient scheduling. Improved forecasting will help reduce underperformance, lower production costs, and enhance ROI for fixed assets.

### Objectives
- Predict future demand for dairy products
- Optimize inventory and supply chain operations
- Improve plant capacity utilization

### Success Metrics
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**
- **Capacity Utilization Rate**
- **ROI Improvement**
